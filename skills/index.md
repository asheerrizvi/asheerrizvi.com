**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** are my primary languages. **TypeScript** is something I like working with in large projects that are worked on by multiple developers. Besides these, I have had a decent exposure to **Python**, **C**, and **C++** as well.

I have extensively used **React** as a UI library and have worked with frameworks like **Next.js** and **Gatsby**. Here are the various technologies with which I have worked in that endeavor:

- For state management in React, I have used libraries like **Redux**, **Zustand**, besides concepts like **state colocation** and **lifting state up**.
- I have done data fetching mostly through libraries like **React Query**, **SWR**, and **Apollo Client**.
- For components, I prefer starting with **Radix** or **Reach UI** and adding styling on top.
- **CSS in JS** is a contested topic these days, and I prefer using **CSS Modules** instead. Previously, I have used solutions like **Styled Components**, **Emotion**, and **Stitches**.
- For testing, I have extensively used **Jest**, the **Testing Library**, and **Cypress**.
- I use **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for API mocking.
- Documentation has mostly been within **Storybook**.

Due to the baggage that comes with React, I have been looking into alternatives like **11ty**, **Svelte**, **Solid**, **Astro**, and **Qwik**. I am super interested in learning about **Web Components** and **PWAs** as well and will be adding them to my skillset very soon.

On the backend, I have some experience working with **Node**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **SQL**, and **GraphQL**.
